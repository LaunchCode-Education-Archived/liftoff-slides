# Live Coding

???
An overview of live coding, what to expect, how to prepare, and a framework for being successful.

---

# Live Coding Format

- **Live Coding**: A programming problem that is solved "live" in front of the interview team.

--
- **Format**: On a Whiteboard, on an online collaboration tool (collabedit.com), or on a computer.

---

# Environment
- Live coding can be stressful because you aren't in your normal environment.

--
- You **Don't** Have: an IDE, Code Complete, the internet, examples of code.

--
- You ** Do** Have: your problem solving skills, and access to another programmer! Ask questions, talk through your logic, get the interview team involved.

---

# Live Coding Process

- A live coding session is all about showing your problem solving skills, so it's good to show your problem solving process.

--

1. Gather requirements
--

2. Break problem down
--

3. Pseudocode
--

4. Code
--

5. Test
--

# Class Activity

- For class today you will be broken into pairs. You will role play the live coding process. One of you will act as the interviewer, and the other will act as the interviewee. Then you will switch roles.

- This will give you a chance to really practice live coding in front of someone else. If you get stuck, try to work through the problem together. If after working together you can't find a solution, grab a TF to help out. Remember the steps of the live coding process.

???
When students get stuck have them go through the steps of the process. Most students struggle with accurately testing their own work.
