# What Are Wireframes?

**Wireframe (n.)**

_A basic visual guide used to suggest the layout of fundamental elements in a web interface._

(Source: Wiktionary)

--

There are lots of tools available to make wireframes, but unless you're a designer, or making a bunch of them, a pen and paper are often the best tools.

---

# User Stories

We'll create some wireframes for views suggested by our initial user stories:

--

**Instructor Stories**

--

- As an instructor or TA, I can log in to the site so I can enter and edit data

--

- As an instructor, after logging in to the site I see a list of my active courses so I can choose which one I want to interact with

--

- As an instructor, when I select a course, I see a table of attendance numbers for the most recent meetings of the course so I can get a high-level view of how my class is doing

???
Create or display some basic wireframes (handdrawn) that outline views for each of these

---

# User Stories

Now that you have some practice, take 10-15 minutes to wireframe some views for some TA stories.

_Note:_ It is **not** the case that you'll have one wireframe per user story. Some stories might describe user interactions that are only a portion of a view, or which are represented across several views.

--

**TA Stories**

--

- As a TA, after logging in to the site I see an attendance entry form for my group, on the most recent or current course date, so I can quickly enter attendance

--

- As a TA, I can enter a student as being present, absent, or excused, so there is a record of everyone's attendance

--

- As a TA, I can quickly mark a student of another TA as here or not here, because TAs are sometimes absent

???
Let students work with their mentors to create some wireframes. Encourage everyone to work both individually, and then together. After time is up, ask a few students to present their wireframes
